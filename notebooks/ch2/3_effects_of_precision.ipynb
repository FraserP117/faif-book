    "The last example demonstrated how to perform Bayesian inference with a probabilistic generating function and Gaussian prior. In this example we examine the effects of how different levels of variance (or the inverse of variance, precision) can affect the Bayesian inference process. This will become very important in future examples of active inference agents whose behavior is very sensitive to levels of precision/variance."
